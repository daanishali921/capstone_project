# Twitter Sentiment Stock Trend Predictor (Currently in Development)

## About

As somebody who spends most of his business days day trading, the majority of the thoughts that are behind the day involve wondering what and how market trends will come into fruition and why.
In the past year and a half, the stock market has seen impactful influences from many different avenues; one of them being social media.
Because of this, I built a tool to help day traders like myself gain insight on the influence of twitter trends on stock trends.

## Deployment

Though in development, the user will be able to go onto an interactive website and choose a stock which the user wants to learn about. 
The user will then be able to pick from a select amount of dates, the machine learning model in the backend will output a prediction where the user will be able to see how well the model has done against true values on the day(s) selected.
The user will be provided with visuals as well as probability values of the predictions.
